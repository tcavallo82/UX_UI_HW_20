        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p class="subClass">The Problem:</p>
        <p>We have observed that Warriors (veterans enrolled in the program) are missing correspondence with the K9’s for Warriors team when there is an immediate need as well as when recertification is due.</p>
        <p class="subClass">The Solution:</p>
        <p> We believe that creating a training milestone application for K9’s for Warriors will ensure training retention with service animals. Our application was designed to provide a clear outline of necessary milestones, personalized assistance, and resources such as well as training videos and articles. Building this kind of relationship will ensure that training is maintained through the course of their service, based on a calendar log of updates for training and recertification of both the Warrior and the Warrior Trainer.</p>

      <h1>User Research</h1>
      <img class="researchImg" src="./images/K9's for Warriors (3) copy.jpg">
      <p class="subClass">User Insight:</p>
      <p>What stood out to us from interviews was a strong desire to regain independence and control. “Life gets in the way” is something I heard a lot. Work, kids, all those everyday things that keep you busy prevent training from being top of mind. Warriors quickly lose touch with the program and they were never quite sure who to reach out to in the first place.</p>

        <p class="wirelead">Early wireframes were built around a calendar concept. Your calendar would show you what milestones were coming due. Upcoming milestones were also shown on the home page and would be checked by the Warrior Trainer when completed.</p>

      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        We strived to create an app that created a solution to the problems K9’s had been facing in relation to communication. Using this K9’s for Warriors milestone application, users can clearly see upcoming goals and what’s expected of them to continue their partnership with the organization.<br>
        <br>
        Next, we want to explore options for those with pending Warrior status. Milestones for those with a “pending” status would involve reviewing required training material followed by tests to ensure the information was reviewed and retained.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to a mobile portal, we would also want to build a desktop version for the client facing side of the application.<br>
        <br>
        Lastly, we would be building a company facing CRM platform for Warrior Trainers to manage customer relations and ensure Milestones are being met.
